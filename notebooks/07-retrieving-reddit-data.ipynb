Trump won the presidency the Senate the House because people are fed up with this kind of mentality. They want a return to common sense where facts matter more than feelings where you can actually have a conversation about something without being accused of some imagined slight. This is exactly why the red wave happened. It is a rejection of the culture that prioritizes personal offense over objective reality. People are tired of living in a society where explaining basic nutritional science is seen as an attack. They want leadership that is straightforward and grounded in reality not the kind of identity politics nonsense that equates information with aggression.\\\\n\\\\nThis is what happens when you live in a world where facts are considered patriarchal where science itself is labeled as offensive if it comes from a man. The American people chose Trump because they want a return to reality to truth to strength and it starts with rejecting this kind of victim mentality.
